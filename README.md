Bombs Away!
===================

A simple iOS game, tap to destroy!


Todo
------------

* Add score and gamecenter support (total # of bombs exploded, most # of bombs exploded in a day)
* Add more bomb types
* Add more sounds
* IAPs: remove ads, buy all bomb types, buy all sounds
* Add bomb-drob animation
* Estimate # of people killed using geonames or PopStat
* Change map to WhirlyGlobe with local copy of maps

Bugs
------------

* The first bomb's timer selector doesn't fire at the correct time (hopefully will be fixed when we change to SpriteKit)
