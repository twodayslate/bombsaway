Bombs Away!
===================

A simple iOS game, tap to destroy!

Get ready to watch the pixels fly with this highly addicting real world simulation game!

Simply tap to destroy!

Pick your target and watch it explode! 'Bombs Away!' has a predefined list of major cities and even your own location you can pick from. Zoom in to hit a specific target or choose to obliterate whole countries at a time.


Todo
------------

* Add score and gamecenter support (total # of bombs exploded, most # of bombs exploded in a day)
* Add more bomb types
* Add more sounds
* IAPs: remove ads, buy all bomb types, buy all sounds
* Add bomb-drob animation
* Estimate # of people killed using geonames or PopStat
* Change map to WhirlyGlobe with local copy of maps

Bugs
------------

* The first bomb's timer selector doesn't fire at the correct time (hopefully will be fixed when we change to SpriteKit)
